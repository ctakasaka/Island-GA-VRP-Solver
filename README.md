# An Approach to Solving the VRP Family with a Parallel Genetic Algorithm

## Implementation completed using Apache Spark (Scala)

We postulate that migratory behavior within a parallel genetic algoritm will increase the diversity of the resulting population. This approach will increase the breadth of the algorithm's potential search surface, reducing the likelihood of falling into local minima.
